Services in Angular:
- A service in angular is a class contains re-usable code(businuss logic, validation, calculations etc.) which can be called in one or more components and also into any other service as well.
- To create a service class we use a decorator i.e. "@Injectable()" it is used to make the sevice accessible from anyother component.
- @Injectable() is availble in "@angular/core" library.
- To use the service in component, we use "Depedency Injuction".
- "Depedency Injuction" is a design pattern which is used to maintain the objects efficiantly and also used to make application as loosly coupled.
- syntax:
import {Injectable} from '@angular/core';

@Injectable()

export class ServiceClass
{
    properties;
    methods;
}
- To consume the service we have 2 approches
    - From the Component section using "providers".
    - From the Module section using "providers".
Note: 
- To create a service by using Angular CLI we use a command "ng g service Name".
- We can't share data among two sibling components directly, but we can do that by using service.

HttpClient:
- It is a pre-defined clas which is used to connect to the servers.
- This class can also be used to make Rest API calls.
- HttpClient it is avaible in the package "@angular/common/http";
- This class will return the data in the form of "Observable".
- "Observable" is used to recive the continues updates from the server wheneven the content is upated.
- "Observable" is avaiable in "rxjs", where it stands for reactive extension for javascript.
Note: In module we have to define HttpClinetModule class which is avaible in "@angular/common/http";
